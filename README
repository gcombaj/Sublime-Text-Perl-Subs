A Sublime-Text 2 Plugin - Perl functions listing
------------------------------------------------

This plugin helps you immediately know where in the Perl file you are

If adds to the status line a small "[PerlSubs: <current>]" mark, so you know in which function you are now.

Also, upon pressing ctrl+alt+l, it opens a list of functions, and clicking on one will jump to it.

INSTALLATION
------------

Drop it to your Sublime Text Plugin directory. on my computer (OSX) it is:
~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/PerlSubs

BUGS
----

1. If the marker is below a function, but not in other function, the plugin will think that you are inside that function.
Not big deal, for me.
